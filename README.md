# CODI Student Game (Concept)

## Description
This is a concept of an interactive story game where you can actually implement it and make it a real game.  

Our goal of this game is that not everything we want to learn comes easy, and we have to put the hard work and efforts in it to achieve our goals, so we have a growth mindset according to [CAROL S. DWECK book: "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322).  

## Explanation
Each file has informations you can use to create the game as everything is set up.

The CODI Student Game Graph.pdf file (created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)) is a graph that has all the branches and the flow of the game (example: if a player choose this path he will go here...).  

The CODI Student Game Script.docx file (created using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)) is a google docs document that has all the script (story) of the game as in the document there will be example for each branch choosen by the player.
